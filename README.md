# Striker_Replacement
The objective of this project is to leverage the power of football statistics and data analysis to identify players from around the world who possess similar playing styles, strengths, and attributes to Robert Lewandowski.

Data Collection: We have meticulously gathered extensive performance data from various football leagues and competitions to create a robust dataset. This includes player statistics such as goals scored, assists, shots on target, key passes, dribbles, and more.

Statistical Analysis: Our project employs advanced statistical methods to quantify different aspects of player performance. These statistics go beyond basic metrics, delving into more nuanced details that define a striker's impact on the game.

Cosine Similarity: The cosine similarity metric is used to measure the likeness between player profiles. By calculating the cosine similarity between Lewandowski's playing style and other players' attributes, we can identify those who closely resemble his skills and characteristics.

How to Contribute:
We welcome contributions from the football analytics community, data enthusiasts, and machine learning experts. Whether you're interested in improving the data preprocessing pipeline, fine-tuning the machine learning models, or enhancing the user interface, your contributions are valuable.
